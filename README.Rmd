```

## Overview

This repository analyzes historical data from the world of Formula 1.
The goal is to conduct comparative analysis of Formula 1 drivers from
different eras and create visuals to uncover interesting insights about
the sport.

## Data Exploration

```{r data_import}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
